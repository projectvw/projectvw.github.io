										/>When I was 17, and my brother was 16, my parents bought us
										a car. It was a 1973 VW Super Beetle (Vin/Chassis #
										1332543365), honestly I didn&#39;t want it, my brother
										wanted a bug, but I was the one who went with dad to test
										drive it, and I was the one who fell in love with the car
										and drive my JR/SR years of high school in Northern
										California, then hauled it to Rolla, Missouri for college.
									</p>

									<p>
										I loved that car, in the summer of 1998 my father and I
										redid the suspension on the car and sent the car to Bryant
										Motors in Sedalia, Missouri to get new wider/fiberglass
										fenders, and a new paint job.
									</p>

									<p>
										The car was there for a good 3 months, maybe more. When we
										got it back, it was gorgeous.
									</p>

									<p>
										Over the next year or two we replaced the motor, with a 1776
										built by Al out in Wentzeville, MO.
									</p>

									<p>
										I got out of school, started working, and the Super Beetle
										got parked in my parents garage in St. Charles, MO.&nbsp;
									</p>

									<p>
										<img
											alt="1973 VW Super Beetle VIN 1332543365"
											src="/assets/images/PSIDE.jpg"
											style="float: left; width: 640px; height: 480px"
											title="1973 VW Super Beetle VIN 1332543365"
										/>In early 2001 it was time for my parents to move to South
										Carolina, and I was going to stay in Missouri, I
										couldn&#39;t really keep two cars, so we sold the Super
										Beetle on Ebay. It sold to a family in Alton, Illinois, not
										far from where we were.They had two young buys (if memory
										serves me correctly) and the car was for them, fitting as
										that is how I came across the car.
									</p>

									<p>
										Over the years I wanted the car back, but I was never able
										to track down any history on Ebay (they limit how far back
										you can go). One day I was digging through old hard drives,
										getting them ready for disposal, when I came across a backup
										of emails from an 18 month timeframe, a timeframe that
										covered summer 2001, when I had sold the car on Ebay.
									</p>

									<p>
										Digging through those emails, I was able to track down the
										name of the family who had purchased the car, and via
										Facebook I was able to track down the father. I reached out
										to him inquiring about the car. Took a while, but when he
										replied he told me the car had gone to Ft Drum, NY with one
										of his boys in the Army, and was sold to another soldier
										there.
									</p>

									<p>
										Since that time I&#39;ve scoured Craigslist, Ebay, and
										Google Image search in hopes of finding my 1973 VW Super
										Beetle again. I have been unsuccessful, but I hold on to
										hope that one day I will find my first car and buy it back.
									</p>

									<p>
										If you have any leads on the car, please let me know,
										<a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/Contact"
											>you can fill out the Contact Form here</a
										>.
