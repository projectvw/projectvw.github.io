"1973 VW Super Beetle Wide Fenders",/1973-VW-Super-Beetle-Wide-Fenders,"<p>When we were redoing our 1973 Super Beetle in the summer of 1998, I wanted to go with wider fenders. We ordered fiberglass fenders from a company called Innovations in Fiberglass. I don&#39;t know if they are still in business or not.</p><p>We put 3&quot; wider fenders on the rear of the car, and 2&quot; wider on the front.&nbsp;</p><p>Here&#39;s a shot of the front</p><p><a data-flickr-embed=""true"" data-footer=""true"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/4322039065/"" title=""73 Super Beetle Autocrossing""><img alt=""73 Super Beetle Autocrossing"" height=""331"" src=""https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4053/4322039065_41870516db.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a><script async src=""//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script></p><p>Here&#39;s a shot of the rear</p><p><a data-flickr-embed=""true"" data-footer=""true"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/33736194413/"" title=""1973 VW Super Beetle Rear End""><img alt=""1973 VW Super Beetle Rear End"" height=""225"" src=""https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4180/33736194413_8a3450fb69.jpg"" width=""300"" /></a><script async src=""//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script></p>",2017-10-10 23:03:10,html,/Portals/5/VWFenders.jpg,""
"Have you seen my 1973 VW Super Beetle? VIN# 1332543365",/Have-you-seen-my-1973-VW-Super-Beetle-VIN-1332543365,"<p><img alt=""1973 VW Super Beetle "" src=""/Portals/5/RED5.jpg"" style=""width: 300px; height: 225px; float: right;"" title=""1973 VW Super Beetle "" />When I was 17, and my brother was 16, my parents bought us a car. It was a 1973 VW Super Beetle (Vin/Chassis # 1332543365), honestly I didn&#39;t want it, my brother wanted a bug, but I was the one who went with dad to test drive it, and I was the one who fell in love with the car and drive my JR/SR years of high school in Northern California, then hauled it to Rolla, Missouri for college.</p><p>I loved that car, in the summer of 1998 my father and I redid the suspension on the car and sent the car to Bryant Motors in Sedalia, Missouri to get new wider/fiberglass fenders, and a new paint job.</p><p>The car was there for a good 3 months, maybe more. When we got it back, it was gorgeous.</p><p>Over the next year or two we replaced the motor, with a 1776 built by Al out in Wentzeville, MO.</p><p>I got out of school, started working, and the Super Beetle got parked in my parents garage in St. Charles, MO.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=""1973 VW Super Beetle VIN 1332543365"" src=""/Portals/5/PSIDE.jpg"" style=""float: left; width: 640px; height: 480px;"" title=""1973 VW Super Beetle VIN 1332543365"" />In early 2001 it was time for my parents to move to South Carolina, and I was going to stay in Missouri, I couldn&#39;t really keep two cars, so we sold the Super Beetle on Ebay. It sold to a family in Alton, Illinois, not far from where we were.They had two young buys (if memory serves me correctly) and the car was for them, fitting as that is how I came across the car.</p><p>Over the years I wanted the car back, but I was never able to track down any history on Ebay (they limit how far back you can go). One day I was digging through old hard drives, getting them ready for disposal, when I came across a backup of emails from an 18 month timeframe, a timeframe that covered summer 2001, when I had sold the car on Ebay.</p><p>Digging through those emails, I was able to track down the name of the family who had purchased the car, and via Facebook I was able to track down the father. I reached out to him inquiring about the car. Took a while, but when he replied he told me the car had gone to Ft Drum, NY with one of his boys in the Army, and was sold to another soldier there.</p><p>Since that time I&#39;ve scoured Craigslist, Ebay, and Google Image search in hopes of finding my 1973 VW Super Beetle again. I have been unsuccessful, but I hold on to hope that one day I will find my first car and buy it back.</p><p>If you have any leads on the car, please let me know, <a href=""http://projectvw.com/Contact"">you can fill out the Contact Form here</a>.</p><p>-Chris Hammond, Wildwood, Missouri</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",2017-05-09 00:19:07,html,/Portals/5/PSIDE.jpg,""
