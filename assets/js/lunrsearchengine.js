To make this major front suspension change, the Super Beetle features different front body sheet metal including front hood, fenders, apron and quarter panels. The front of the chassis is changed as well to accommodate the new suspension design. The body is the same as Standard Beetle from the “A” pillar back. The chassis is the same as the Standard Beetle from the framehead back. The bumpers, turn signals, headlights and most trim items such as the hood handle are the same as the Standard Beetle. MAJOR BODY STYLE CHANGE. :  Larger curved windshield.  Longer wiper arms and blades.  Shortened front hood to accommodate larger windshield.  Aluminum cowl molding added at body line between door jamb and hood.  Larger “elephant foot” tail light.  Front seats have wider, more round headrest.  Larger plastic air cleaner housing with paper element.  No oil drain plug on oil sump plate.  Hood emblem removed from top of hood.  Running board molding narrowed to 10mm.  Transmission mounts change for less driveline vibration.  Mid year, externally regulated alternator replaces the generator.  Special Edition “Sports Bug” offered.  Last year for thin channel bumpers. **(All of the above information is standard model information for US spec VW Beetles. VW was always changing the Beetle and often times did so in the midst of any given model year so it is common to see mis-matched components on any given model year. ) "

I was able to reach out to the father of that family around 10 years later, he told me the car went to Fort Drum in New York when one of his sons went that way. That’s the last I’ve been able to find anything about the car. Can you help me find it? Contact Chris Chassis Number: 1332543365 Unfortunately CarFax won’t search cars that old (before VINs) "

    "body": "2022/02/01 - When my dad and I planned out the overhaul of the 1973 Super Beetle I really wanted to go with a wide fender look for the car. We ended up ordering new fenders from Innovations in Fiberglass some time in 1998. We ordered 2” wider in the front and 3” wider in the rear and took the car up to Bryant Motors in Sedalia Missouri to do the work necessary to repaint the car. It was definitely a unique look, and I think turned out great. If I build another Super Beetle, I would likely do the same thing, though I would love to have more lighting options now, almost 25 years later, with the advancement in LED technology.  "

    "body": "2021/01/11 - Before the car was blue (painted in the summer of 1998 in Sedalia, Missouri), it was red. It was a deep red, with a little sparkle to it. The car came this color when we acquired it in 1993(94?) in Fairfield, California. I honestly don't recall what the original color of the car was, likely a red or orange, but not the deep sparkly red it is in these photos. These photos were most likely taken after I had washed the car out in front of the Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity house in Rolla, Missouri.  You can see the bra that I had on the car, I believe it was on it when we acquired the car. When was the last time you saw a bra on a car? If you need one for a Porsche Boxster I happen to have one, new in box here in my basement. If you look closely at the hubcaps, you can see I painted them. I completely forgot I did that until looking at these photos. You'll also see a silver pinstripe on the car, it is just vinyl, something acquired from an autoparts store and applied. That was most likely the first vinyl I ever applied to a car, lots more since. I am still looking for this car if you happen to see it, let me know!

    "body": "2017/05/09 - When I was 17, and my brother was 16, my parents bought us a car. It was a 1973 VW Super Beetle (Vin/Chassis # 1332543365), honestly I didn&#39;t want it, my brother wanted a bug, but I was the one who went with dad to test drive it, and I was the one who fell in love with the car and drive my JR/SR years of high school in Northern California, then hauled it to Rolla, Missouri for college. I loved that car, in the summer of 1998 my father and I redid the suspension on the car and sent the car to Bryant Motors in Sedalia, Missouri to get new wider/fiberglass fenders, and a new paint job. The car was there for a good 3 months, maybe more. When we got it back, it was gorgeous. Over the next year or two we replaced the motor, with a 1776 built by Al out in Wentzeville, MO. I got out of school, started working, and the Super Beetle got parked in my parents garage in St. Charles, MO. &nbsp; In early 2001 it was time for my parents to move to South Carolina, and I was going to stay in Missouri, I couldn&#39;t really keep two cars, so we sold the Super Beetle on Ebay. It sold to a family in Alton, Illinois, not far from where we were. They had two young buys (if memory serves me correctly) and the car was for them, fitting as that is how I came across the car. Over the years I wanted the car back, but I was never able to track down any history on Ebay (they limit how far back you can go). One day I was digging through old hard drives, getting them ready for disposal, when I came across a backup of emails from an 18 month timeframe, a timeframe that covered summer 2001, when I had sold the car on Ebay. Digging through those emails, I was able to track down the name of the family who had purchased the car, and via Facebook I was able to track down the father. I reached out to him inquiring about the car. Took a while, but when he replied he told me the car had gone to Ft Drum, NY with one of his boys in the Army, and was sold to another soldier there. Since that time I&#39;ve scoured Craigslist, Ebay, and Google Image search in hopes of finding my 1973 VW Super Beetle again. I have been unsuccessful, but I hold on to hope that one day I will find my first car and buy it back. If you have any leads on the car, please let me know, you can fill out the Contact Form here. -Chris Hammond, Wildwood, Missouri &nbsp; &nbsp; "
