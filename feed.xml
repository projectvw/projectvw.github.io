        <title>1973 Volkswagen Super Beetle Red</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Before the car was blue (painted in the summer of 1998 in Sedalia, Missouri), it was red.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a deep red, with a little sparkle to it. The car came this color when we acquired it in 1993(94?) in Fairfield, California. I honestly don’t recall what the original color of the car was, likely a red or orange, but not the deep sparkly red it is in these photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These photos were most likely taken after I had washed the car out in front of the Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity house in Rolla, Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the bra that I had on the car, I believe it was on it when we acquired the car. When was the last time you saw a bra on a car? If you need one for a Porsche Boxster I happen to have one, new in box here in my basement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look closely at the hubcaps, you can see I painted them. I completely forgot I did that until looking at these photos. You’ll also see a silver pinstripe on the car, it is just vinyl, something acquired from an autoparts store and applied. That was most likely the first vinyl I ever applied to a car, lots more since.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>1973 VW Super Beetle Wide Fenders</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When we were redoing our 1973 Super Beetle in the summer of 1998, I wanted to go with wider fenders. We ordered fiberglass fenders from a company called Innovations in Fiberglass. I don&amp;#39;t know if they are still in business or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We put 3&amp;quot; wider fenders on the rear of the car, and 2&amp;quot; wider on the front.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a shot of the front&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; data-footer=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/4322039065/&quot; title=&quot;73 Super Beetle Autocrossing&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;73 Super Beetle Autocrossing&quot; height=&quot;331&quot; src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4053/4322039065_41870516db.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Have you seen my 1973 VW Super Beetle? VIN# 1332543365</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;1973 VW Super Beetle &quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/RED5.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px; height: 225px; float: right;&quot; title=&quot;1973 VW Super Beetle &quot; /&gt;When I was 17, and my brother was 16, my parents bought us a car. It was a 1973 VW Super Beetle (Vin/Chassis # 1332543365), honestly I didn&amp;#39;t want it, my brother wanted a bug, but I was the one who went with dad to test drive it, and I was the one who fell in love with the car and drive my JR/SR years of high school in Northern California, then hauled it to Rolla, Missouri for college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved that car, in the summer of 1998 my father and I redid the suspension on the car and sent the car to Bryant Motors in Sedalia, Missouri to get new wider/fiberglass fenders, and a new paint job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The car was there for a good 3 months, maybe more. When we got it back, it was gorgeous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next year or two we replaced the motor, with a 1776 built by Al out in Wentzeville, MO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got out of school, started working, and the Super Beetle got parked in my parents garage in St. Charles, MO.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;1973 VW Super Beetle VIN 1332543365&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/PSIDE.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float: left; width: 640px; height: 480px;&quot; title=&quot;1973 VW Super Beetle VIN 1332543365&quot; /&gt;In early 2001 it was time for my parents to move to South Carolina, and I was going to stay in Missouri, I couldn&amp;#39;t really keep two cars, so we sold the Super Beetle on Ebay. It sold to a family in Alton, Illinois, not far from where we were.They had two young buys (if memory serves me correctly) and the car was for them, fitting as that is how I came across the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years I wanted the car back, but I was never able to track down any history on Ebay (they limit how far back you can go). One day I was digging through old hard drives, getting them ready for disposal, when I came across a backup of emails from an 18 month timeframe, a timeframe that covered summer 2001, when I had sold the car on Ebay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digging through those emails, I was able to track down the name of the family who had purchased the car, and via Facebook I was able to track down the father. I reached out to him inquiring about the car. Took a while, but when he replied he told me the car had gone to Ft Drum, NY with one of his boys in the Army, and was sold to another soldier there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since that time I&amp;#39;ve scoured Craigslist, Ebay, and Google Image search in hopes of finding my 1973 VW Super Beetle again. I have been unsuccessful, but I hold on to hope that one day I will find my first car and buy it back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any leads on the car, please let me know, &lt;a href=&quot;http://projectvw.com/Contact&quot;&gt;you can fill out the Contact Form here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Chris Hammond, Wildwood, Missouri&lt;/p&gt;
