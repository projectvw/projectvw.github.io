I"¡<p>So this website has been up for a few weeks now, and after looking at the Traffic here on the site, we&#39;re getting incoming search links for the term Bicycle Legs.</p>

<p>So I had to do a little digging and see what the term means. According to the urban dictionary, Bicycle Legs is used to basically refer to banged up shins.</p>

<p>So I can proudly, or shamefully, say, that I too have bicycle legs. While riding a couple of weeks ago, coming up to a stop sign to get onto Highway 1 here in Northern California, I managed to somehow miss the pedal completely and skinned up my shin. It is just now about healed.</p>

<p>What is your worst Bicycle Legs story?</p>
