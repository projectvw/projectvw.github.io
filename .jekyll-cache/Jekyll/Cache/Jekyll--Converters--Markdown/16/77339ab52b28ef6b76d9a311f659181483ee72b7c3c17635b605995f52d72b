I"?<p>As 2019 comes to a close (in a couple of months anyways) registration for 2020 events around the world are starting to open up. We&#39;ve already had the registration for the 2020 LandRun100 open and fill. In order to try to ensure that we personally don&#39;t miss registration for any events we want to attend, and so that we can try to plan out what 2020 might look like, we through a Google calendar together.</p>

<p>On this calendar we&#39;re adding events that we are thinking about attending, as well as reminders for registrations dates for those events. This is by no means a comprehensive list of events, so far it contains the events we are considering attending here, mostly in the MidWest. We&#39;re open to adding other events to this calendar, if you&#39;d like to see your event added <a href="https://www.bicycletips.com/about">drop us a line</a>.</p>

<p>Now, get on over to the <a href="https://www.bicycletips.com/event-calendar">Event Calendar page</a> here on the site and check it out! Registration for The Epic (MO) opens up this Thursday.</p>
