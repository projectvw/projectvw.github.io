I"Q<p>So as a new bike rider I am highly concerned about being safe while I ride. I also don&rsquo;t like the idea of carrying my wallet with me while I ride. It&rsquo;s bulky, could get lost, or who knows what else.</p>

<p>Last year while watching the Tour de France I saw advertisements for <a href="http://www.roadid.com/?referrer=7754" target="_blank">RoadID</a> and I though, what the heck is that for? Well, this year as I started riding I quickly figured it out.</p>

<p>What would happen if I got into an accident while I was out riding, sans wallet. What if I was unable to speak, how would anyone know who I was, where I lived, or how to get in touch with my wife and baby?</p>

<p>They wouldn&rsquo;t. So I decided to start carrying my driver&rsquo;s license when I rode, but that didn&rsquo;t actually help either. We recently moved, so the address on my driver&rsquo;s license was no longer correct, and it sure didn&rsquo;t have any other way to get in touch with my family listed on it.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://www.roadid.com/?referrer=7754" target="_blank">RoadID</a>. With RoadID you have a bracelet that you can wear, and when you order your <a href="http://www.roadid.com/?referrer=7754" target="_blank">RoadID</a> you get to customize what it says on it. I put the following information on my <a href="http://www.roadid.com/?referrer=7754" target="_blank">RoadID</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>CHRISTOPHER J HAMMOND<br />HALF MOON BAY, CA USA<br />Wife ###-###-####<br />Home ###-###-####<br />NO KNOWN ALLERGIES<br /><a href="http://www.chrishammond.com/">WWW.CHRISHAMMOND.COM</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Now, hopefully if I am ever in an accident on the road, I am identifiable! Though I guess I lied about the no known allergies part, there was this swimsuit that I wore as a kid, it changed patterns when wet. That damn thing gave me hives, not fun.</p>

<p>So when you ride, be sure to carry some form of ID that can be found easily. You definitely don&rsquo;t want to be a missing person or a John/Jane Doe!</p>
