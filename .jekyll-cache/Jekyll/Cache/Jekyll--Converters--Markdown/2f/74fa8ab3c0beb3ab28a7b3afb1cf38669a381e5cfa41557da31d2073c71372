  My grand vision of building the Bicycle Tips brand/website in 2020 were apparently dashed with Covid. That hasnâ€™t stopped the riding, though there has been less than planned, and no organized rides after The Mid South in March. Early in the summer we started the idea of riding the Katy Trail again. Once again planning for the end of September/early October as <a href="https://www.bicycletips.com/home/2017/10/riding-the-katy-trail-from-clinton-to-machens-katytrail2017" target="_blank">a few of us had done in 2017</a>. This time we started planning that we would do it fully self supported, no one meeting us each evening carrying our gear, we would carry our own gear this trip. In order to make sure that was possible, we planned a shakedown ride over Labor Day weekend.</p>
