I"^<p>The team at Big Sugar Gravel is probably very happy, and a little less stressed out this morning! The registration for BSG opened at 8am central time this morning, and if you weren&rsquo;t quick, you missed out! It looks like all 800 spots sold out in under 5 minutes.</p>

<p>I was able to get in, I would like to think I was the first person to register, but we&rsquo;ll never know. Did you get in? What are your training plans?</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll be writing up some of our 2020 training plans here on the site as we&rsquo;ve got a lot scheduled for the year, and 2019 isn&rsquo;t even over yet!</p>
