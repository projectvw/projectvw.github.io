<p>So as we near the 2019 running of the Dirty Kanza everyone is likely starting to taper down their training and finish up with organizing any supplies and items needed for the event.</p>

<p>Being that this is the first year that myself, Steve and Chris (3 St. Louis boys) are doing the ride, we are going into things a little blind, but one of the things that Steve and I talked about on our <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2381297533" target="_blank">final long training ride this past Sunday</a>, was a list of things to bring.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P7GA-IxfJSoqaOZ1jW2gd904je2bCMIiqqPLK7UDH5o/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">Last night I started to put together a list of Google Sheets that I decided I would share it for anyone else who might be wondering what all they should bring to the Dirty Kanza</a>! I&rsquo;ve added &ldquo;where&rdquo; I plan to have the item, in the SAG vehicle, on the bike, in my backpack, etc, along with a category. Not sure if the category is really necessary, but more info can&rsquo;t hurt right? (see over packing note)</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve got any feedback, things you think we missed, things you think we&rsquo;re crazy for bringing, shoot us a message on <a href="https://twitter.com/bicycletips" target="_blank">Twitter @BicycleTips</a> and let us know!</p>

<p>Couple of items that I thought about and hope you&rsquo;ll find handy.</p>
<ol> <li>Water sprayer (garden type), should be good for cleaning the bike, be sure to fill it with water before you leave your hotel!</li> <li>Mud Stick, I read an article from Salsa Bikes the other day in which a rider suggested having a device to trying to get mud off your bike, a stick of some sort, perhaps a screw driver?</li> <li>Extra of ALMOST everything, you never now.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <em>Being that this is our first DK100 ride, we&rsquo;re likely bringing things we don&rsquo;t need, and forgetting things we should bring, so we&rsquo;ll try to update this document AFTER the ride too, to help us remember for next year! I also am a habitual over-packer, so&hellip;. </em></p>
