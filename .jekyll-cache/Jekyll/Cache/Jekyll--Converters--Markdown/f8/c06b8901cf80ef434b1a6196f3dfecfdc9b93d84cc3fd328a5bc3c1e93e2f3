I"Å<p><img alt="Dark Morning" src="/portals/18/content/1-3-12-DarkMorning_320.jpg" style="float: right;" />I set my alarm this morning for 6am, with plans to get in a 45 minute ride before I took a shower and came in to work. I went to bed around 11pm last night, read for a while, and tossed and turned until about 2am, I guess those cookies and milk at 9:30pm weren&rsquo;t such a good idea as the sugars kept me up.</p>

<p>6am came and my alarm went off, at first I turned it off and decided I would sleep in. Then I lay there thinking &ldquo;Get up you lazy ass, go ride&rdquo; so I did. I got up, and peered out the blinds to see what the sun was starting to do.</p>

<p>It was dark outside, very dark, with no hint of sunshine.</p>

<p>It took me a while to figure out when sunrise was scheduled, I should have checked last night. The default Weather/News app on Android 4.0 doesn&rsquo;t tell you sunrise/sunset times, and the Weather channel&rsquo;s mobile site doesn&rsquo;t either, it took me quite a while finding it on their desktop site with my Galaxy Nexus. When I did find the time</p>

<p>Sunrise this morning was at 7:25am, so basically I was up an hour too early. I do not yet have the gear for an early morning o-dark-thirty bike ride, in order to do that I need to get a good headlight and tail lights for the bike, as my <a href="http://www.bicycletips.com/tips/aid/4">previous contraption that I used for the Fourth of July isn&rsquo;t something I want to use on a regular basis</a>.</p>

<p>So I didn&rsquo;t ride this morning, instead I headed in to work early so I could perhaps get out in time for a quick ride this evening before sunset (which is at 5:04pm tonight).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hoping to do a series of reviews on lighting equipment for bike rides, if you&rsquo;re a manufacturer or distributor and want to have your equipment included in the reviews please fill out the <a href="http://www.bicycletips.com/about">Contact Us form on the About page</a>.</p>
