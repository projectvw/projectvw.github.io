I"!<p>So if you follow us on <a href="http://twitter.com/bicycletips" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/bicycletips">Facebook</a> you likely saw that Sunday was a planned ride day, but while trying to make sure I had air in my tires I ended up tearing one of the tubes. Not having any spares around was the first lesson, always have some extras!</p>

<p>So on Monday I ran out and picked up 3 tubes, between mine and the wife&#39;s bike I hope 3 will last us a little bit.</p>

<p>I realized I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever changed a bike tire before, so I figured, I may as well stick a camera up on the wall and film the process. I also took the camera out into the garage while I put air in the tire, but the lighting was so bad I didn&#39;t bother doing anything with that part of the video.</p>

<p>So here it is, our first video for BicycleTips.com, I promise future videos will have higher production quality! This was just last minute thrown together and edited.</p>
