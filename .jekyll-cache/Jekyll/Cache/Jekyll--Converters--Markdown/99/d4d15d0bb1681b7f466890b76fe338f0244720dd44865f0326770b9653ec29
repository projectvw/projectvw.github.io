<p>In prep for my riding of the Dirty Kanza 100 coming up in June, I&rsquo;ve been trying to get some miles in, and looking for some gravel that is &ldquo;near by&rdquo; to get some gravel miles in as well. Last week I was talking with my neighbor, who tends to ride his bike(s) a little, he mentioned the <a href="https://gorctrails.com/trails/femme-osage">Femme Osage Trail</a>, but I wasn&rsquo;t able to head out with him on Saturday afternoon. Sunday morning I decided I would try to map out that route based on what he said, and started looking on GravelMap.com.</p>

<p>Digging through GravelMap I picked out a trail called the Hamburg Trail, that takes off from the Katy Trail in St. Charles County and goes out towards <a href="https://gorctrails.com/trails/busch-wildlife">Busch Wildlife in Weldon Spring</a>. Leaving the Katy Trail onto the Hamburg trail you climb about 300 feet and head towards &ldquo;<a href="https://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/10044">The Mound</a>&rdquo;, which is an interesting read in its own right. Once you pass the Nuclear Waste Adventure Trail, you&rsquo;ll go by Hell (Francis Howell High School), and then cross over Hwy D into the Busch Wildlife area.</p>

<p>In Busch Wildlife there are 25 miles of gravel roads, many of those don&rsquo;t connect to anything, but you can ride in/out on them to get some distance in. I ended up doing two loops today in a segment that I&rsquo;m calling &ldquo;<a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2326417589/segments/58792243451">Busch Squiggle Outer Loop</a>&rdquo; that is a 7:31 miles.</p>

<p>There may be better gravel out there, but this little route is a great ride for me. It shows me how much effort it takes to ride 40 miles on gravel versus road, and how much training I need to get in before Dirty Kanza coming up!</p>

<p>Next weekend I&rsquo;m riding the Tour Of Hermann Gravel Challenge, hoping to get 60 miles in on Saturday with 50 miles in on Sunday, but we&rsquo;ll see if my body holds up to that. I came home today and took a 3 hour nap, I need to look at some way to better fuel my body so I&rsquo;m not destroyed after longer rides.</p>
