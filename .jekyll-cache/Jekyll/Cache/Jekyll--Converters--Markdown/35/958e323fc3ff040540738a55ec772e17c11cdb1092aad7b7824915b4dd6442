She loved it! If by loving it, I mean, she pretty much slept through the whole thing.</p>

<p>A little back story, Jacqueline is coming up on 10 months old here in the next week and a half. She had a doctors appointment last week and the doc said it was okay to start pulling her behind the bike in a trailer if she&rsquo;s strong enough to sit herself up. So we took the opportunity today to do just that.</p>

<p>We loaded up the bikes and trailer, and headed over to Bicycle Sundays on Ca√±ada Road in San Mateo County. Basically on most Sundays they shut down a 2.5 mile stretch of the road south of highway 92, for biking. It is a nice smooth surface, and a safe place to ride, there are tons of folks out there.</p>

<p>A few things.</p>
<ol> <li>Always make sure your bike trailer is in top shape, remember what you have sitting in there, you&rsquo;d hate to have something happen to your child!</li> <li>Be prepared for a work out!</li> <li>Watch out for rattles. No, not baby rattles, or rattlesnakes, just noises. More on that later</li></ol>
<p>Being the first time I&rsquo;d towed anything behind a bike, I didn&rsquo;t really know what to expect. I did spend the morning make sure all the attachments were sound, and ready for the ride. I then took about 35 pounds of weight and put it in the trailer and rode around the neighborhood. All seemed to go well, so I was comfortable putting the baby in there, with her helmet of course.</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed, pulling a trailer is pretty straight forward, the only thing I really noticed was the extra weight, and the rattles. The rattles I will take care of though with some strategically placed tape (probably hockey tape as I have some around). The rattling was primarily occurring on the trailer where the safety pins go in to hold things together, a little tape I think will keep them in place and reduce the rattling noises. It didn&rsquo;t appear to bother the baby at all, but it sure annoyed me!</p>

<p>As for the weight, it felt like I was towing a parachute around behind me, especially when going into the wind. Speaking of wind, we had the mesh screen down, but not the plastic window, the wind didn&rsquo;t seem to bother the baby one bit.</p>

<p>We rode about 10 miles today, it sure seemed like one of the hardest workouts I&rsquo;ve had on the bike yet, I am sure that is due to the baby, but also due to the fact that around the house in Half Moon Bay we pretty much ride on flat ground, where Ca√±ada road had some elevation changes to it.</p>

<p>What are your tips for towing a child behind your bike?</p>
