I"	<p><img align="right" alt="SF2G" src="http://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/1-9-12-SF2G_337.jpg" style="float: right;border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;" />As I get more and more into cycling I am looking for more and more things to get my cycling. I live in Half Moon Bay, and while my wife has started to ride as well, it is hard for us to get out for long rides because we have a 15 month old baby (15 months today!, happy 15 months <a href="http://www.jacquelinehammond.com/">Jacqueline</a>). While we get out occasionally with the baby in tow, we typically each ride solo.</p>

<p>In that quest to find riding events and people to ride with, etc I stumbled on <a href="http://http://sf2g.com/" target="_blank">SF2G</a>, a club (website) for people in the bay area looking for others to ride with. I believe it started out as a way to get people to ride their bikes from San Francisco City to Google, by some Google employees.</p>

<p>It has grown into 1800+ members and a variety of different rides, along with members from a wide range of companies and locations. Every first Friday of the month they do a <a href="http://sf2g.com/nrlb.html" target="_blank">First Friday Friendly Frolic (FFFF)</a> in which they go with a No Rider Left Behind policy. They leave from a designated location and head south on the &ldquo;BayWay&rdquo; which primarily covers the bayside trail, and the necessary side streets in order to make it all the way down to the Google offices and various others.</p>

<p>I am going to try to ride with them starting this February, though in order for me to do this I am going to have to do things a little out of the ordinary. I don&rsquo;t have the legs (yet) to ride from Half Moon Bay to my office in San Mateo, much less up to the starting point for FFFF, so I am going to drive up to the Daly City Bart station, then ride Bart up to wherever I need to go to meet up with FFFF. Then ride along until Foster City, at which point I will jump off and head west to the <a href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com" target="_blank">DotNetNuke</a> offices.</p>

<p>This is a little backwards, out of the way, but it is something I feel like I should try to do. Then hopefully, after work, I can ride my back to the Milbrae Bart station, and then catch that back to Daly City to get my car.</p>
