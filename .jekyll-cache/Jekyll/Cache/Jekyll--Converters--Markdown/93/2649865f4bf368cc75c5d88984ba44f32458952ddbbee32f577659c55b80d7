I"s<p>As you (I) prep for 2020, well, wait to get over my sinus thing I&rsquo;ve got going, I&rsquo;m starting to figure out everything I&rsquo;m going to need for the rides. Most of the rides we&rsquo;ve scheduled, daylight shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue, but I&rsquo;m planning on riding Dirty Kanza 200, so I will most assuredly be riding in the dark. With winter, and all the riding I need to be doing, I&rsquo;ll be riding in the dark long before the end of May.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been planning to get some lighting from <a href="https://www.outboundlighting.com/">Outbound Lighting</a>, a group that launched their Focal Series back in November 2017, nearly doubling their $15k goal. They were (are?) based near St. Louis MO at one point, but I think have moved up to Chicago. They&rsquo;re still a fairly small shop, hand assembling each light, often times with a few week waiting period before their next batch is ready for shipment.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been asking fairly regularly at Trailhead Bicycles when they were going to start carrying them, but they didn&rsquo;t have an ETA the last time I asked. Last night I checked and their lights were selling at the usual price, $200 for the trail or road package, this morning when I woke up I found them available for $25 off. Order placed! Hopefully I&rsquo;ll have them here in the next two or three weeks, and hopefully I can get my sinuses cleared out by then.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not 100% sure how I will deal with the length of time I will be riding after dark at DK, I imagine it will be 6-7 hours, so we&rsquo;ll have to see if I need to come up with a different battery situation for the lights. I&rsquo;m tempted to take some old LI batteries from my drone racing days and see if I can&rsquo;t come up with a nice high capacity all night lighting system.</p>
