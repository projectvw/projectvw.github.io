I"X<p>Two weeks in to the new year and we’re back with a post! Life got in the way of our plans of having more posts here early on in the year, but that’s okay, we’re getting life squared away and have been doing plenty of riding/training to make up for the lack of posts here.</p>
<h2>So let’s get things started with what is in the works for 2020</h2>
<p>First things first, the planned rides. 2020 is going to be a busy year, we’ve already written about a few of the planned rides, but let’s document them here for now, always subject to change though as schedules align and diverge.</p>
