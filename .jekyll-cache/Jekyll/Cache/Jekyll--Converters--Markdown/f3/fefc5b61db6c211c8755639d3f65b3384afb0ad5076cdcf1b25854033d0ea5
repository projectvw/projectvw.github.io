I"¤<p><img alt="Dark Morning" src="/portals/18/content/1-3-12-DarkMorning_320.jpg" style="float: right;" />I set my alarm this morning for 6am, with plans to get in a 45 minute ride before I took a shower and came in to work. I went to bed around 11pm last night, read for a while, and tossed and turned until about 2am, I guess those cookies and milk at 9:30pm weren&rsquo;t such a good idea as the sugars kept me up.</p>
