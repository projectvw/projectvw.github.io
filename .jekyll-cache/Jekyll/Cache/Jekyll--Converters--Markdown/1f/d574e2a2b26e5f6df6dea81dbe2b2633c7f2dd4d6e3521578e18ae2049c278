<p>So I finally got around to trying out the IMapMyRide application on my Android phone today, along with my Garmin <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CSWCQA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishammondc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=B000CSWCQA" target="_blank">ForeRunner 305</a> which I always use when I ride. Overall, I would say the application itself is pretty slick, nice interface, different than <a href="http://sportstracklive.com/?r=bicycletips" target="_blank">SportsTrackLive</a>, though I am not sure it is any better yet.</p>

<p>One thing I was shocked, and perhaps I should have just done more research, is the limitations that MapMyRide has on their website, unless you are a paying member. In their defense, <a href="http://sportstracklive.com/?r=bicycletips" target="_blank">SportsTrackLive</a> is also a paying thing, for their Pro version, but honestly I paid once and that was it. I purchased the &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; app in the Android Marketplace for $4.84, to be honest, I had to look up the price, I couldn&rsquo;t recall what it was. Less than $5.</p>

<p>MapMyRide has multiple pricing schemes, free gets you the basics, unlimited routes, workout tracking, calendar, and charts. Paying gets you &ldquo;printed maps&rdquo;, though I have no idea why you would want/need those, 1/4/12 fitness reports per year, removes Ads from the website, and lets you setup 3/5/unlimited training plans. The pricing goes from $6/month all the way up to $20/month. That $5 one time fee so far from <a href="http://sportstracklive.com/?r=bicycletips" target="_blank">SportsTrackLive</a> is pretty attractive at those prices.</p>

<p>When I completed my ride, uploading the track on MapMyRide was quick and easy, it did appear to be far faster than <a href="http://sportstracklive.com/?r=bicycletips" target="_blank">SportsTrackLive</a> has been in the past.</p>

<p>The MapMyRide website is 100x prettier than STL, though I am having trouble trying to see how I can change my recent route from Private to Public. I believe I set it to private when I finished the ride, with the intention of updating it once I got on the computer and verified the information. Anyone got any tips for that?</p>

<p>So, as of right now, I don&rsquo;t see MapMyRide taking my riding program anywhere that <a href="http://sportstracklive.com/?r=bicycletips" target="_blank">SportsTrackLive</a> can&rsquo;t, but I will give it a few more rides and see how things play out. I can assure you that Garmin Connect won&rsquo;t be leaving my stable of software anytime soon. As I play with these other tools, GC keeps track of all the rides so I have somewhere to go to get all the data, in one place.</p>
