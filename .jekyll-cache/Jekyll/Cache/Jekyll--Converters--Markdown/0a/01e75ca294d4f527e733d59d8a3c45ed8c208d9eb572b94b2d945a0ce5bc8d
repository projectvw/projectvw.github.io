Natalie and I are just over 48 hours away from our 100 mile bike ride in Davis California for the Team LIVESTRONG Challenge. We both haven&rsquo;t ridden near enough in the past two weeks, but hopefully we are still ready for the ride. We did put in a training ride up in Vacaville a few weeks ago (<a href="http://app.strava.com/rides/9515330" target="_blank">strava route</a>) and a climbing/raining ride in Maui during our vacation earlier this month (<a href="http://app.strava.com/rides/10171729" target="_blank">strava route</a>).</p>
