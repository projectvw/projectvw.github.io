I"[	<p>So here we go, yet another blog for me, but this time for something a little different than what I usually (<a href="http://www.project240z.com/" target="_blank">project350z.com</a>, <a href="http://www.project240z.com/" target="_blank">project240z.com</a>, <a href="http://www.dnndaily.com/" title="DotNetNuke Tips and Tricks">dnndaily.com</a>, <a href="http://www.solo2.org/">solo2.org</a>) blog about. Bicycles!</p>

<p>Some may ask, who are you? Well, I am <a href="http://www.chrishammond.com/" target="_blank">Chris Hammond</a>, I&rsquo;m a 34 year old software guy. What do I know about bikes? Well, to be honest, not much, but I figured as I go on this new journey (into the world of bicycles) I would keep a record of all the things I learn! So I picked up this domain name (along with .net and .org) last year, but am just now getting around to putting it to use.</p>

<p>So here we are, I&rsquo;ve setup a Twitter account (<a href="http://twitter.com/bicycletips" target="_blank">@bicycletips</a>), this website, a quick logo, quick header image (using a simple CSS override for the <a href="http://multifunction.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">MultiFunction Free DotNetNuke Skin</a>. and now I have this first post coming together. What will hopefully be the first of many many more to come. In fact, I wrote this post first, but I really have a whole other post I wanted to write. I just felt like I couldn&rsquo;t write that one, until I semi-launched this site with a first post.</p>
<h2>What should you expect from BicycleTips.com?</h2>
<p>Well the goal for this website is to provide a single location for all the &ldquo;tips&rdquo; I come across in my exploits learning to ride a bike. Alright, so I learned to ride a bike a LONG time ago (29 or 30 years ago), but I am just now (in the past few weeks) getting back into it. I haven&rsquo;t really ridden a bike since I was probably 13 or 14.</p>

<p>As new posts are added, and the content here becomes more in depth, you&rsquo;ll be able to click on the list of &ldquo;categories&rdquo; or tags on the left side of the Tips page to see other posts. Right now, being the beginning of this website we don&rsquo;t have those categories listed just yet, but will be adding them shortly.</p>

<p>So sit back, grab a drink, and enjoy the ride here at <a href="http://www.bicycletips.com/" target="_blank">BicycleTips.com</a></p>
