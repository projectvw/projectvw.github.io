<p>There are many obvious health benefits to riding your bicycle, and by riding you bicycle year round you can work to keep your body in shape for the prime riding&nbsp;in Spring Summer and Fall. One of the best benefits I&rsquo;ve found to cold/chilly weather riding is the clearing out of the sinuses!</p>

<p>For the past two weeks or so I&rsquo;ve had a slight head cold, sinus infection perhaps? Every time I head out to ride I clear right up. I&rsquo;m not the snot rocket kind of rider, have never even attempted it, as I know I would just get snot allover myself in the attempt, so most of my &ldquo;clearing&rdquo; goes the other way, which I easily dispose of to the side of the road with a targeted discharge from the kisser.</p>

<p>Next time you are feeling a little closed up in the sinuses, head out for a bike ride, get your heart pumping, and do your best to try to breath through your nose, see if you can&rsquo;t get that head cleared right up.</p>
