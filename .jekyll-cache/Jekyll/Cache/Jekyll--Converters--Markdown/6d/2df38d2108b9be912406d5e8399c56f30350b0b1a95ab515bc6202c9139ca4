I"<p>The weekend before Thanksgiving I decided to strap one of my new GoPro HD Hero2 cameras on to my bicycle helmet and take it with me for a ride. I ended up with 1.5 hours of video, rather than let you watch the entire boring (wind filled) ride, I took some of the clips and put them together into a short video.</p>

<p>This ride was down Highway 1 (south), past the GoPro headquarters to the Cowell-Purisma trailhead, then west towards the water on the trail. Up the trail, a pretty flat ride except for the down and up through one of the gorges (canyons?), back to 1 at Cowell Beach. Back west on Poplar towards the beach, around the Poplar parking lot where the crew for Men of Mavericks (Iron Cross Productions) has a bunch of trailers and gear stored. From there I head north on the trail and back to our house.</p>
