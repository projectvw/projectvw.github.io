I"p<p><a href="http://www.bicycletips.com/tips/aid/39" target="_blank">Two of my three cycling goals were completed in the past few weeks</a>. First, I rode Pedal The Cause 2017, the century again. I didn&rsquo;t walk any this year, though I did leave out the Babler Beast loop this year. I was fighting a cold, and it was very warm, I knew if I attempted it I would struggle to finish the ride, so I cut it short and completed 93.4 miles with 4600&rsquo; of elevation gain on the route. A big thanks to everyone who helped me out this year with donations, I raised $650, bringing my lifetime PTC fundraising to $4,956.69.</p>
