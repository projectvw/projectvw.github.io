I"ö<p>So this won&rsquo;t necessarily be a tip, but it will hopefully be something for people to comment on with their own thoughts. I&rsquo;m new to cycling, I&rsquo;ll explain more of that over the next few weeks, but just understand that I&rsquo;ve not really ridden a bike in years, until the past couple of weeks.</p>

<p>In the past 4 weeks, since getting my new bike, I&rsquo;ve put 95.32 miles on the bike, and on my legs. For the first couple of weeks that riding was once a week, though I am trying to up that frequency. Two weekends ago I rode twice (Sunday/Monday for ~25 miles total), and then this past weekend I rode three times (three days, ~36.38 miles total). I could definitely feel my legs on our ride yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p>At least I think I could feel my legs, that or it was a lot windier than it had been for my previous rides, maybe it was both. Today, at work, my legs feel tired. Worn out, ready to relax. So I decided I wouldn&rsquo;t try to ride after work tonight. I planned to take tonight off, and then ride tomorrow. I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;ll ride tomorrow (Tuesday) or take another day off.</p>

<p>What do you experienced riders recommend? Ride ride ride? Or ride and rest? Remember, I&rsquo;m knew to this whole thing.</p>
