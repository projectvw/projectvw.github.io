I"y<p>So if you follow us on <a href="http://twitter.com/bicycletips" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/bicycletips">Facebook</a> you likely saw that Sunday was a planned ride day, but while trying to make sure I had air in my tires I ended up tearing one of the tubes. Not having any spares around was the first lesson, always have some extras!</p>
