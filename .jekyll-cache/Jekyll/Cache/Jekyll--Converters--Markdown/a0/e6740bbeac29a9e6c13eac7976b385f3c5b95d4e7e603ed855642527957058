I"@<p>So this won&rsquo;t necessarily be a tip, but it will hopefully be something for people to comment on with their own thoughts. I&rsquo;m new to cycling, I&rsquo;ll explain more of that over the next few weeks, but just understand that I&rsquo;ve not really ridden a bike in years, until the past couple of weeks.</p>
