<p><img align="right" alt="Bicycle YouTube Video" src="/portals/18/Content/1-17-12-YouTube_705.jpg" style="float: right;" />One of the things that I&rsquo;ve been trying to do while riding is figure out how to record my rides, for a couple of reasons. 1) To create cool creative videos. 2) To document events, who knows what can happen on the road, having video proof could help out some day. I think I can safely say that #2 is a far better, easier to attain, idea, than #1. And when you come up with a reason that justifies #2, you likely have something worth using for #1.</p>

<p>Why might I say that? Well it is pretty simple, bike riding video is rather boring. At least the video that my 34 year old ass is able to shoot while riding. Why? A number of reasons. I&rsquo;m just getting started with riding, having put on about 144 miles on a bike in the first 3 weeks of the year, last year I put just under 600 miles in total, and what I ride would be considered rather tame, at least, it is rather tame in my eyes. I don&rsquo;t do downhill mountain biking, I haven&rsquo;t done any group rides, it is just me, sometimes me and my wife, or me and a friend, riding. Mostly road, but occasional dirt paths and trails. Nothing exciting by any means.</p>

<p>So the videos that come from that riding are to put it bluntly BORING.</p>

<p>See the following video for example. This video is from last weekend, I went out to Orinda with a buddy of mine to ride, we rode 14.5 miles, climbing 1.6k feet, the most climbing I have ever done on a bike. Our average speed was 8mph&hellip; You can see where I am going with this, boring video! Though it does look a little more interesting when you compress that 1.75 hours into 2 minutes.</p>

<p>and don&#39;t forget the video from a couple of months ago riding around <a href="http://www.bicycletips.com/tips/aid/17">Half Moon Bay, CA</a></p>

<p>These videos were all taken with one of my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005WY3TMA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishammondc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005WY3TMA">GoPro Camera HD HERO2 Motorsports Edition CHDMH-002</a><img alt="" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=chrishammondc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B005WY3TMA" style="border-width: initial !important; border-color: initial !important; border-image: initial !important; margin-top: 0px !important; margin-right: 0px !important; margin-bottom: 0px !important; margin-left: 0px !important;border-style: none !important;" width="1" />.</p>

<p>What do you think? Is bicycle riding video boring in general, or just mine?</p>
