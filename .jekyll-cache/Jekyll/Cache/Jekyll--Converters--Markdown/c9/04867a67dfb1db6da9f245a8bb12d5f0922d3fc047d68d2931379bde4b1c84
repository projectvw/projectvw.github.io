Well if that was good for a big guy like me, 2012 is going to be kickass! I hit 500 miles on the bike today for 2012, with 2 days left to spare in February.</p>

<p>In January I did 256 miles, and for February I&rsquo;ve done 245. Of those 501 miles I&rsquo;ve climbed around 20930 feet, with 11,417 of that coming in February, and 3k of that coming on my <a href="http://app.strava.com/rides/4280953">ride up Tunitas Creek last weekend</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve still got a long way to go in 2012, my big goal is the 100 miles at Team LIVESTRONG Challenge in Davis California on June 24. In addition to that I&rsquo;m doing a 100k with the Santa Rosa Cycling Club in May, and maybe even&nbsp; that 60k in Gilroy in April.</p>
