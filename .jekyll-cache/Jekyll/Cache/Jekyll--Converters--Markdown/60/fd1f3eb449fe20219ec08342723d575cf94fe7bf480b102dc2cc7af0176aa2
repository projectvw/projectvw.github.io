I"ì<p>Here we are, day 3 into <strong>30 days of biking</strong> (the month known as April). I came home from the office early today, left at 5pm, missing the Bay Area <a href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com" target="_blank">DotNetNuke</a> User&rsquo;s Group meeting (<a href="http://www.baydug.org">www.baydug.org</a>). I stopped by the lbs (<a href="http://www.bikeworkshmb.com">www.bikeworkshmb.com</a>)&nbsp; to see what they might have in terms of a road bike for my wife, she&rsquo;s 5&rsquo;10&rdquo; tall so that pretty much rules out most &ldquo;women&rsquo;s&rdquo; bikes, so I figured I would see what they had in a 56cm or so in men&rsquo;s. They had a couple of lower end Specialized Allez, similar to mine, but with lower end components.</p>
