I"n<p>Last Wednesday I went for a ride at lunch time with a coworker of mine. I decided to take the <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-5311515-10456937?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fstyle%2FCJ%2F794062%3Fpartner%3Daff_cj%26mr%3AtrackingCode%3D5DECBDAC-FA10-DF11-BAE3-0019B9C043EB%26mr%3AreferralID%3DNA&amp;cjsku=794062" target="_blank">GoPro Camera</a> along with me for the ride, though not attached to the bike itself, or to me, I attached it to a 3 foot pole, that I mounted to the front of the bike.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re thinking &ldquo;boy, that sounds like it won&rsquo;t work&rdquo; you are correct. It didn&rsquo;t work out very well, the pole wasn&rsquo;t near stable enough for the camera, so it made for a very wobbly video of the ride. I still think it is interesting though, so I editing, sped up, slowed down, and uploaded it to YouTube. You can see it here.</p>

<p>As you can see the video isn&rsquo;t worth much. I took what I learned from the experiment and tried to create a better mount for my car for the autocross this past weekend. That didn&rsquo;t work out so well either, but <a href="http://www.project350z.com/Articles/itemId/549/Mounting-a-video-camera-behind-your-car.aspx">you can read about that over on Project350z.com</a>.</p>

<p>After the ride we got back to the car, and I remember getting ready to remove my Garmin <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CSWCQA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishammondc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=B000CSWCQA" target="_blank">Forerunner 305</a> from the bike, but I don&rsquo;t think I actually removed it entirely. I did remove the camera from the bike, and put it in the car. Later that evening I went to look for the Garmin and it was gone, nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>I looked throughout my car, looked around my desk at the office, in the garage at the office, and even went to the location where the car was parked. Unfortunately I was unable to find it <img alt="Sad smile" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-sadsmile" src="$wlEmoticon-sadsmile[2].png" style="border-style: none;" /></p>

<p>I posted an ad on Craigslist in the Lost and Found section with the hope that someone would find it and return it, but I haven&rsquo;t been that lucky. Speaking of not being lucky, or just being stupid. Today I went and picked up another Forerunner 305 off of someone on Craigslist, with two chargers and a heart rate strap, for $85. I thought it was a good deal, until I got home and realized that the UP button on the Garmin doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>I think it will still work for what I need, but I won&rsquo;t be able to do things like adjust the contrast. I&rsquo;m tempted to take it apart and see if I can fix it, but so far I haven&rsquo;t been able to get the Forerunner 305 to come apart. I should probably just leave well enough alone and use it as is.</p>

<p>Lesson learned! Don&rsquo;t trust anyone selling anything on Craigslist, always test something before you buy it.</p>
