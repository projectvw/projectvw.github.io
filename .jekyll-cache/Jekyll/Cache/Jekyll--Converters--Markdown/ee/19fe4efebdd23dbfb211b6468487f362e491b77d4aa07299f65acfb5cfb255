I"Ò<p>As you (I) prep for 2020, well, wait to get over my sinus thing I&rsquo;ve got going, I&rsquo;m starting to figure out everything I&rsquo;m going to need for the rides. Most of the rides we&rsquo;ve scheduled, daylight shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue, but I&rsquo;m planning on riding Dirty Kanza 200, so I will most assuredly be riding in the dark. With winter, and all the riding I need to be doing, I&rsquo;ll be riding in the dark long before the end of May.</p>
