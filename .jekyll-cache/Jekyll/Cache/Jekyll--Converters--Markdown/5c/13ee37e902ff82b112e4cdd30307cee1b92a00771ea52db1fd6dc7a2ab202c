I"K	<p>As the registration opens up for Big Sugar Gravel in Bentonville Arkansas later this week (Friday at 8am CST) you might want to start thinking about accommodations. We learned last year that for hotels in Emporia Kansas around Dirty Kanza you have to book WELL in advance. Like, we booked in July of this year for the event next May, even though registration doesn&rsquo;t open until January.</p>

<p>For the past few weeks the hotels around Bentonville haven&rsquo;t shown any availability around the Big Sugar Gravel ride, which is scheduled on 10/24/2020. Last night however we found that at least one hotel, the Hilton Garden Inn in Bentonville started showing as available that week. So we booked a room.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re smart and book a rate that can be cancelled, you shouldn&#39;t have any problem cancelling your reservation if you don&#39;t make it into the ride registration.</p>

<p>Not all hotels are showing availability that far into the future yet, what we can recommend from experience, is setting yourself a reminder to check hotels every day. When choosing your dates, try booking Thursday through Sunday, or Monday. If a hotel shows nothing available those dates, try to the &ldquo;try other dates&rdquo; option. That might give you some insight into how far into the future you can currently book.</p>

<p><strong>Location:</strong></p>

<p>Big Sugar is being organized in conjunction with Outerbike Bentonville. I don&rsquo;t know if the location for Outerbike 2020 has been specifically posted yet, but it looks like Outerbike 2019 in Bentonville was held around the &ldquo;buckyball&rdquo; field, which is near the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/cSVkst8iyo5kzqHm9" target="_blank">Crystal Bridges museum</a>. Assuming that Big Sugar start will be somewhere around there, it looks like the hotels near 102 and interstate 49 will be the best option for lodging options in 2020, as they look to be no more than a few miles away.</p>

<p>You can always cancel if you don&rsquo;t make it through the registration process. If you missed out on a hotel, it they fill up soon, you can always look for cancellations. Last year for Dirty Kanza we lucked out about a week beforehand, getting a room at the Super 8, giving us the ability to cancel our reservations we had in Topeka Kansas, which saved us a good 2 hours of driving each day.</p>
