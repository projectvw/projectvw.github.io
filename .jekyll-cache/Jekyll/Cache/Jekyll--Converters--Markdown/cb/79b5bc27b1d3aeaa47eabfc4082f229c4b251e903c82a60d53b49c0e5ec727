I"¤<p>I&#39;ve debated for the past few weeks if I was going to set any goals for 2014. I&#39;m didn&#39;t really complete many of my goals for 2013, but I have decided that I should at least set a few simple goals to work towards.</p>

<p>Last year I rode 822 miles on the bicycle, far less than the 1800 miles the year before. For 2014 I want to ride 2000 miles by bicycle. That&#39;ll require that I ride a lot more than I did in 2013. Tomorrow it is supposed to snow, I&#39;m thinking it might be a good time to take the mountain bike out for a spin! To be honest, that&#39;ll just be around the yard to see how dangerous riding is in the snow, but before the end of January I need to have at least 50 miles under my belt.</p>

<p>2011:608 Miles</p>

<p>2012: 1809 Miles</p>

<p>2013: 822 Miles</p>

<p>2014: ?</p>

<p>Assuming I do actually get to riding more, I&#39;ll be updating BicycleTips.com more often as well in 2014.</p>
