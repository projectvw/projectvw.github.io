<p><img alt="30 Days of Biking Day 1" src="http://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/content/April-1-12-705.jpg" /> I can&rsquo;t believe I forgot about this, but fortunately I was able to get ride in for Day 1 of 30 Days of Biking 2012. <a href="http://30daysofbiking.com/">http://30daysofbiking.com/</a> What? 30 days of biking? Isn&rsquo;t <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/sets/72157628676234297/" target="_blank">Toddler366</a> enough for you Chris? No, it isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>So what is 30 Days of Biking? Well, plain and simple, bicycling at least once, every day, in April 2012. Why? Why not. Biking is good for you, the more you do it, the better you feel, the better shape you are in.</p>

<p>How much will you be riding? That depends on my schedule. Some days it will just be a quick ride around the neighborhood, some days I&rsquo;ll get in multiple rides. Hopefully every day I will get at least one ride in though, even if it is short.</p>

<p>The difficult part for me is that I am likely going to be travelling to the east coast at the end of the month, and getting a ride in with that may prove hard, though I may try to ride a couple of times, even if short, with my good buddy Stephen Jones from <a href="http://www.velonation.com">www.velonation.com</a>, but we&rsquo;ll see how that comes along.</p>

<p>With each ride, assuming I ride with my Garmin, I will post up my Strava report from the ride. So here is Day 1&rsquo;s ride.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning we headed off to REI to see what we might find at the Garage Sale. We didn&rsquo;t plan on buying anything, but we had never been, so we went with open minds. Well, we scored. We ended up getting the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048MB82A/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishammondc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0048MB82A">iBert Safe-T-Seat Front Child Seat (Green,38-Pounds limit)</a><img alt="" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=chrishammondc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0048MB82A" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px;        border-width: 0px;border-style: none !important;" width="1" /> for a steal, really, too low to even post about here!</p>

<p>We immediately went home and tried putting it on my Cannondale Quick CX 1, unfortunately it wouldn&rsquo;t work on that bike, so we tried it on Natalie&rsquo;s Quick CX 3 and it did work. Jacqueline loves it! As you can see in the photo at the top of the post.</p>
