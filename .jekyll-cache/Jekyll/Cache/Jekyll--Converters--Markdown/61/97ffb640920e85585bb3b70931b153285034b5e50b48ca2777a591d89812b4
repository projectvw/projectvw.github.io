I"õ<p>When we were redoing our 1973 Super Beetle in the summer of 1998, I wanted to go with wider fenders. We ordered fiberglass fenders from a company called Innovations in Fiberglass. I don&#39;t know if they are still in business or not.</p>
<p>We put 3&quot; wider fenders on the rear of the car, and 2&quot; wider on the front.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a shot of the front</p>
