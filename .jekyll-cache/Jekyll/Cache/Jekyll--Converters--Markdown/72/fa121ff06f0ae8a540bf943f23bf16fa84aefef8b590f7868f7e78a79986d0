I"%<p>I have attempted to set new years resolutions in the past, but I typically failed at them, and most times I failed quite early on. For this year I set 3 goals, 1 of them I am pretty confident I won&rsquo;t hit, more on that later, but two of them I had/have every intention of hitting.</p>
