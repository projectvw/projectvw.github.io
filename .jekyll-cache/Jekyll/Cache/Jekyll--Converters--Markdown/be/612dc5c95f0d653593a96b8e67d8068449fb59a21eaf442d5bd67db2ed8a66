I"Ð<p>The announcement about Big Sugar Gravel just dropped a couple of days ago and there is already a change! The registration was originally announced as this Friday, the 1st of November, but HAS BEEN MOVED to Friday November 15th, 2019.</p>

<p>It looks like the registration conflicted with the Rooted Vermont registration, so BSG moved their registration back to the 15th.&nbsp; (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4HvHYuncaS/">you can dig through the Instagram Comments on this post to see</a>)</p>

<p><s>Assumption is, it will be at 7am on the 15th, but we&#39;ll update this page with more information as it is available.</s></p>
