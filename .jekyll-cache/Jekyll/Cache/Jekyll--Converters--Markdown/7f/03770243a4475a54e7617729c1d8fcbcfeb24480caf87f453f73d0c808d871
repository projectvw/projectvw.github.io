I"h<p>So I’ve spent the last 15 years looking for this car, haven’t had much luck.</p>

<p>I sold the car in 2001 on Ebay, a family out of Alton, Illinois purchased it. I was able to reach out to the father of that family around 10 years later, he told me the car went to Fort Drum in New York when one of his sons went that way.</p>

<p>That’s the last I’ve been able to find anything about the car.</p>

<p>Can you help me find it? <a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/Contact">Contact Chris</a></p>

<p>Chassis Number: 1332543365</p>

<p>Unfortunately CarFax won’t search cars that old (before VINs)</p>
