I"ê<p>As the registration opens up for Big Sugar Gravel in Bentonville Arkansas later this week (Friday at 8am CST) you might want to start thinking about accommodations. We learned last year that for hotels in Emporia Kansas around Dirty Kanza you have to book WELL in advance. Like, we booked in July of this year for the event next May, even though registration doesn&rsquo;t open until January.</p>
