I"m<p>Earlier this year I had a <a href="https://www.bicycletips.com/tips/2019/04/getting-a-retul-bike-fit-done">Retul Bike fit done at Trailhead Bicycles</a> in Ellisville, MO. One of the changes made during that fitment was to my saddle. At&nbsp;the time I upgaded to a Specialized Power Expert as my saddle for the Niner RLT I rode on gravel all year. This change was night and day, completely mindblowing how much of a difference it made to my comfort level while riding. So much that when I got off the gravel bike in August to prep for Pedal The Cause on my road bike I moved the saddle over to that bike as well.</p>
