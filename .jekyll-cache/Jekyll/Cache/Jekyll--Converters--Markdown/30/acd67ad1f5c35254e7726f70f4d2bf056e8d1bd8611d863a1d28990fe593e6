I"m<p>2016 was a fairly down year for my biking, I think I only commuted to the office a handful of times, and my total mileage for the year was well under 1,000 miles. I&#39;m planning a couple of things in 2017 that will hopefully get me to exceed that poor showing (819 miles), and hopefully triple it, with an ultimate goal of riding 2,500 miles for the year.</p>
