I"@<p>So Day 2 is the day I actually remembered about 30 Days of Biking, fortunately we managed to ride yesterday, for Day 1. Today I had to work. After work I came home and took Jacqueline out for a quick spin.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the bike seat for the baby won&rsquo;t fit on my Cannondale CX, so I rode Natalie&rsquo;s bike around a bit. The baby loves it, she points, talks, and is downright happy when riding around on the bike.</p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t ride far, just around the neighborhood a few times to get 2 miles in, but we rode 2 more miles than I planned when I got up this morning!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the Strava data.</p>
