I"Q<p><img align="right" alt="SF2G" src="http://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/1-9-12-SF2G_337.jpg" style="float: right;border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;" />As I get more and more into cycling I am looking for more and more things to get my cycling. I live in Half Moon Bay, and while my wife has started to ride as well, it is hard for us to get out for long rides because we have a 15 month old baby (15 months today!, happy 15 months <a href="http://www.jacquelinehammond.com/">Jacqueline</a>). While we get out occasionally with the baby in tow, we typically each ride solo.</p>
