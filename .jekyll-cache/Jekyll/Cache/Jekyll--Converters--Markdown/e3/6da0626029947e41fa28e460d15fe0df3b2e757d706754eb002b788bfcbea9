I"S<p>So I finally got around to trying out the IMapMyRide application on my Android phone today, along with my Garmin <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CSWCQA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishammondc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=B000CSWCQA" target="_blank">ForeRunner 305</a> which I always use when I ride. Overall, I would say the application itself is pretty slick, nice interface, different than <a href="http://sportstracklive.com/?r=bicycletips" target="_blank">SportsTrackLive</a>, though I am not sure it is any better yet.</p>
