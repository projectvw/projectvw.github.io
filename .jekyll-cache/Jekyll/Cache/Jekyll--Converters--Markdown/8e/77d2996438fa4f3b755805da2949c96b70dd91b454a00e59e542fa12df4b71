<p>So this is actually a very common question on the internet, and why would I post about it? Because I had the question, and I had to spend time looking it up and reading, so for all of you newbies (like me) who are getting into biking, the question stands.</p>

<p><strong>Do you wear underwear with bicycle shorts? </strong>The short answer is <strong>NO</strong>. The longer answer follows below.</p>

<p>So why did I even have to ask the question? Well since we started riding Natalie and I have both have realized that wearing padded shorts, otherwise known as a chamois, is a must. While a chamois doesn&rsquo;t make all the un-comfortableness of a bike saddle go away, they help greatly, as in, TONS.</p>

<p>When you start riding, padding or no padding, you are going to be sore, no ifs ands or buts, alright, maybe some buts. I found that with consistent riding most of that goes away, a week or two, maybe a little more. But every time you ride, unless you have a big cushy seat, you&rsquo;re going to have some discomfort, that is where the chamois comes in.</p>

<p>So when I started riding I got some padded shorts, sort of a liner (removable) for a pair of mountain biking shorts, I just assumed that you also put underwear on beneath it. I picked up another pair of shorts, and a bib as well, with each I wore underwear.</p>

<p>When I was in Lincoln Nebraska a few weeks ago, I rode 17 miles around a 3.25 mile loop, round and round I went, and sore and sore I got. I wasn&rsquo;t sure why, but I had the thought that it was likely the seam on my boxer briefs causing the issue.</p>

Before we headed out I decided I would ride with just the shorts on, no underwear underneath. I wasn&rsquo;t really sure what to expect, but I tell you what, WAYYYYYYY more comfortable!</p>

<p>Now, with that in mind, be sure to wash your shorts and chamois frequently! There are also products like <a href="https://amzn.to/2OX5ufE" target="_top">chamois butt&rsquo;r</a> that you can apply to both the chamois and your rear end. I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure what they were for, until I figured out this whole underwear thing!</p>

<p>So, back to the question in case you missed it above! Do you wear underwear with your bicycle shorts? NO!</p>
