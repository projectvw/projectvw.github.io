Before the car was blue (painted in the summer of 1998 in Sedalia, Missouri), it was red.

It was a deep red, with a little sparkle to it. The car came this color when we acquired it in 1993(94?) in Fairfield, California. I honestly don't recall what the original color of the car was, likely a red or orange, but not the deep sparkly red it is in these photos.

These photos were most likely taken after I had washed the car out in front of the Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity house in Rolla, Missouri. 

You can see the bra that I had on the car, I believe it was on it when we acquired the car. When was the last time you saw a bra on a car? If you need one for a Porsche Boxster I happen to have one, new in box here in my basement.
