I'll offer up a $250 cash reward for someone who can put me in touch with someone that can be verified as the owner of my first car, a 1973 VW Super Beetle, chassis number 1332543365.


I'll pay $100 for someone who WAS previously an owner of the car (verified) that might lead me to the current owner.

Chassis Number: 1332543365

Can you help me find it? [Contact Chris Hammond](https://www.chrishammond.com/Contact)
