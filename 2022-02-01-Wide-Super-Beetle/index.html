	When my dad and I planned out the overhaul of the 1973 Super Beetle I really
	wanted to go with a wide fender look for the car. We ended up ordering new
	fenders from Innovations in Fiberglass some time in 1998.
</p>

<p>
	We ordered 2” wider in the front and 3” wider in the rear and took the car up
	to Bryant Motors in Sedalia Missouri to do the work necessary to repaint the
	car.
</p>

<p>
	It was definitely a unique look, and I think turned out great. If I build
	another Super Beetle, I would likely do the same thing, though I would love to
	have more lighting options now, almost 25 years later, with the advancement in
	LED technology.
